00:00:00,532 --> 00:00:02,535
According to Quantum Mechanics,

2
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:07,542
all particles in the universe are described by what we call a wave function,

3
00:00:07,542 --> 00:00:11,853
and quantum wave functions are described by Schrodinger’s Equation.

4
00:00:12,831 --> 00:00:18,310
Although the behavior of all subatomic particles is inherently probabilistic,

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,650
Schrodinger’s equation does not itself contain any probabilities.

6
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:29,402
The probability of every possible observation is determined by the wave function,

7
00:00:29,402 --> 00:00:31,740
but prior to the observation,

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,751
the wave function changes and evolves in a completely deterministic manner.

9
00:00:37,768 --> 00:00:41,328
This deterministic way in which a wave function behaves

10
00:00:41,328 --> 00:00:46,288
without any observer present is what Schrodinger’s Equation describes.

11
00:00:47,935 --> 00:00:51,034
Charged particles exert forces on one another.

12
00:00:54,964 --> 00:00:58,963
We can view this by saying that at different points in space,

13
00:00:58,963 --> 00:01:03,085
a charged particle has a different amount of potential energy.

14
00:01:08,313 --> 00:01:14,628
The height of this graph at each point in space is represented by the variable “V”.

15
00:01:22,237 --> 00:01:25,503
The height does not represent a spatial dimension,

16
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:30,896
but the value of the potential energy for our charged particle at each location.

17
00:01:36,306 --> 00:01:39,596
“M” represents the mass of the particle.

18
00:01:47,447 --> 00:01:52,167
“H bar” represents Planck’s constant divided by two pi.

19
00:01:59,548 --> 00:02:05,505
This variable represents the value of the wave function at each point in space and time.

20
00:02:11,577 --> 00:02:16,344
This graph shows a wave function along just one of the three spatial dimensions.

21
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:27,581
At each point in space and time, the wave function is a complex number

22
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:31,041
with a real a component and an imaginary component.

23
00:02:46,258 --> 00:02:47,859
This expression indicates

24
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:53,187
how much the wave function changes as X increases by a small amount.

25
00:03:01,846 --> 00:03:07,337
This change is a complex number which can be represented with arrows as shown.

26
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:23,758
Without changing the X coordinate or direction of any of these arrows,

27
00:03:23,758 --> 00:03:27,811
let us show each of these arrows starting along the X axis.

28
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:38,877
The amount by which these arrows change as we increase X by a small amount

29
00:03:38,877 --> 00:03:41,724
is represented with this other expression.

30
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:58,878
At each point in space, the sum of these three values

31
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,657
is a complex number represented with the following symbol.

32
00:04:20,084 --> 00:04:24,565
We have now covered all the symbols on the left part of Schrodinger’s equation.

33
00:04:30,215 --> 00:04:33,256
Let us now focus on the right side of the equation.

34
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:46,585
As in the previous example, this graph represents the value of a wave function

35
00:04:46,585 --> 00:04:49,974
along just one of the three spatial dimensions.

36
00:04:52,563 --> 00:04:58,155
These arrows indicate how much the wave function at each point in space will change

37
00:04:58,155 --> 00:05:01,724
if the time increases by a small amount.

38
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,901
Without changing the X coordinate or direction of any of these arrows,

39
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:22,500
let us show each of these arrows starting along the X axis.

40
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:32,250
If we multiply these arrows by “h bar”, their length changes.

41
00:05:42,086 --> 00:05:46,365
If we then multiply these arrows by the imaginary number “i”,

42
00:05:46,365 --> 00:05:49,894
all these arrows are rotated by 90 degrees.

43
00:05:58,621 --> 00:06:02,154
Each of these arrows now represent a complex number

44
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:05,844
which is equal to the right side of Schrodinger’s equation.

45
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,810
The right side of Schrodinger’s equation must always equal the left side.

46
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:26,242
If a particle is moving in just one dimension,

47
00:06:26,242 --> 00:06:30,294
then Schrodinger’s equation can be simplified to the following.

48
00:06:44,607 --> 00:06:50,136
If we have a function with a shorter wavelength, then this parameter is larger.

49
00:06:56,704 --> 00:07:02,798
For both sides of the equation to be equal, this other parameter must also be larger.

50
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,951
This other parameter represents how quickly the wave function is rotating.

51
00:07:20,827 --> 00:07:25,347
Therefore, if we have a wave function with a shorter wavelength,

52
00:07:25,347 --> 00:07:29,064
the wave function must rotate with a higher frequency.

53
00:07:32,961 --> 00:07:36,770
The higher the frequency, the higher the energy of the particle.

54
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:44,790
If the energy of the particle is known, and is represented by the variable “E”,

55
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:49,319
then the right side of Schrodinger’s equation is equal to the following.

56
00:07:55,638 --> 00:08:00,146
Therefore, if the energy of a particle is known with certainty,

57
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,415
Schrodinger’s equation can be simplified as shown.

58
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:23,598
If we also know the potential energy at each point in space,

59
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:26,317
symbolized by the variable “V”,

60
00:08:26,317 --> 00:08:31,017
we can then calculate all the possible wave functions for the particle.

61
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,166
