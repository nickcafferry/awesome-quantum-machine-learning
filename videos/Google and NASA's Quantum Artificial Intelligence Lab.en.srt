00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:11,250
understand quantum physics you don't

them to get very hot as I start speaking

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:42,810
so tell me if I start to look really

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:45,270
shiny quantum physics puts everything

13
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:47,610
into question it defies every intuition

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,160
you have about the natural world quantum

15
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,540
is a very strange regime of physics

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,950
things can exist in this state of

17
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,720
superposition where they can be like

18
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,290
ghosting on each other where they could

19
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,940
be this and that at the same time be

20
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,680
entanglement quantum entanglement to

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,530
objects if that quantum mechanically

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,299
entangled I still strongly related to

23
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,939
each other even though they can be a

24
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:12,210
vast distance apart there's a notion of

25
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:15,569
the multiverse there's a whole family of

26
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,009
hardwoods and different states and going

27
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:19,889
through different experiences and

28
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,780
different life trajectories the famous

29
00:01:19,889 --> 00:01:24,060
one is quantum tunneling tunneling

30
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,549
tunneling tunneling is the slippage

31
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,469
between universes for a long time people

32
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,079
thought those effects only existed in

33
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:34,920
the microscopic domain like atoms

34
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:37,350
electrons photons but really it's the

35
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,689
theory of our universe so if you want to

36
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,579
build a quantum computer you want to

37
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:43,920
incorporate those new phenomenon into

38
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,299
information processing maybe in quantum

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,219
computation is one of those instruments

40
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,920
that's going to allow us to see quantum

41
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:51,749
effects at the human scale Google and

42
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,130
NASA have teamed up to share one of the

43
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:55,499
world's first commercial quantum

44
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,419
computers this machine made by Canada's

45
00:01:55,499 --> 00:02:22,500
d-wave will be installed in a NASA

46
00:01:57,419 --> 00:02:25,319
Research Center in California this is

47
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,659
the inside of one of our dilution

48
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,269
refrigerators all of this infrastructure

49
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:32,069
is to basically operate the chip at a

50
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:33,710
temperature that Stuart is a magnitude

51
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:38,060
colder than interstellar space

[Music]

53
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:43,870
the the processor is a quantum computer

54
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,959
but users things called qubits

55
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:53,950
everyone's being either one for a zero

56
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,750
qubit can also be both at the same time

57
00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:00,370
therefore bringing about a quantum leap

58
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,370
in terms of power

59
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:06,849
harnessing principles of reality that

60
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:11,560
are up until very recently completely

61
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:14,549
not reservable by us is just fascinating

62
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:18,150
in ways that i can't completely

63
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:21,220
articulate the overwhelmingly obvious

64
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:23,620
killer app for quantum computation is

65
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:26,079
optimization optimization problems are

66
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,239
extremely difficult problems actually

67
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:31,269
all Google service centers together will

68
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,670
not be capable of coming up with the

69
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:37,269
best solution to these optimization

70
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:39,280
problems as they get larger so now what

71
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:40,810
is an optimization problem I give you an

72
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,879
example you want to do a trip through

73
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:45,159
South America and you want to visit a

74
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,930
number of cities and then you ask what

75
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:50,140
is the cheapest ticket I can get to

76
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:52,090
visit let's say 20 cities and you can of

77
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:56,440
course different routes and different

78
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:58,120
airlines and sort of imagine I list all

79
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,040
the different options I have for my

80
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,810
different routes to travel to the cities

81
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,569
we currently have civilization we

82
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:07,359
generate vast amounts of data it could

83
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:10,599
be climate data genomic data but it's

84
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:13,209
very difficult to generate useful

85
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:15,790
insights off times from that data if you

86
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:17,950
can solve optimization problems better

87
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:20,149
you have an important resource at your

88
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:24,010
hand

[Music]

90
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:30,910
I think unless it teaches us that we

91
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:33,270
should be naive about the world that we

92
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:36,670
shouldn't think about the world as a

93
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:39,180
simple machine since forces us to

94
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:42,940
consider you know more sophisticated

95
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:47,560
notions of how the reality around us is

96
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:50,770
actually shape I can't ask it how long

97
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,290
I'll live or the meaning of life really

98
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,840
we don't know what the best questions

99
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,790
are to ask that computer that's exactly

100
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,430
what we're trying to understand now to

101
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:03,100
me the most important question is are we

102
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:05,410
alone and I have a feeling that quantum

103
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:08,770
computers as they mature are going to

104
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:11,170
help us answer that question this is

105
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,950
have caused a more long-term research

106
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:16,870
endeavor and they're still tremendous

107
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:20,470
obstacles and and big questions some of

108
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:23,350
those will be addressed in d-wave some

109
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:27,430
will be addressed at NASA in some at

110
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:29,860
Google I wasn't sure I would be able to

111
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,510
experiment with a quantum computational

112
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,750
device in my lifetime and now I'm

113
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:38,740
confident that I will be able to how

114
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:40,900
amazing it is that we with our monkey

115
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,750
heritage monkey brains and monkey

116
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:47,380
fingers have somehow lucked into a brain

117
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:49,450
that allows us to ask legitimate

118
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,010
questions about the nature of physical

119
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,590
reality

120
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:57,470
that's so cool

121
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:59,320
with that human risk to go forth into

122
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,760
the unknown frontier

123
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:05,570
whether it's space exploration or

124
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:09,950
quantum exploration we do it because we

125
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:10,710
must we do it because that's what it

126
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:21,149
means to be human
