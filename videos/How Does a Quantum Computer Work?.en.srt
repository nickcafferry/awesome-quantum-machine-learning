1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,089
a classical computer performs operations

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:09,450
using classical bits which can be either

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:12,480
0 or 1 now in contrast a quantum

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:15,599
computer uses quantum bits or qubits and

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,330
they can be both 0 and 1 at the same

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,609
time and it is this that gives a quantum

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,680
computer it's superior computing power

8
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:25,320
there are a number of physical objects

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,920
that can be used as a qubit a single

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,390
photon a nucleus or an electron I met up

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,460
with researchers who are using the

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,520
outermost electron in phosphorus as a

13
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,739
qubit but how does that work well all

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,140
electrons have magnetic fields so

15
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:43,230
they're basically like tiny bar magnets

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,149
and this property is called spin if you

17
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,460
place them in a magnetic field they will

18
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,170
align with that field just like a

19
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,390
compass needle lines up with the

20
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,579
magnetic field of the earth now this is

21
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,980
the lowest energy State so you can call

22
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,890
it the zero State or we call it for the

23
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,260
electron spin down now you can put it in

24
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,989
a one state or spin up but that takes

25
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,970
some energy if you took out the glass

26
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:07,170
from your compass you could turn the

27
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,830
needle the other way but you would have

28
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,720
to apply some force to it you have to

29
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:15,180
push it to flip to the other side and

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,720
that is the highest energy state in

31
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,640
principle if you were so delicate to

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,950
really put it exactly against the

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,450
magnetic field it would stay there now

34
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,790
so far this is basically just like a

35
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,439
classical bit it's got two states spin

36
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,990
up and spin down would you like the

37
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,759
classical one and zero but the funny

38
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,829
thing about quantum objects is that they

39
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,900
can be in both states at once

40
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:39,720
now when you measure the spin it will be

41
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,490
either up or down but before you measure

42
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,920
it the electron can exist in what's

43
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,570
called a quantum superposition where

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,640
these coefficients indicate the relative

45
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,130
probability of finding the electron in

46
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,320
one state or the other now it's hard to

47
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,970
imagine how this enables the incredible

48
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,670
computing power of quantum computers

49
00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:00,930
without considering two interacting

50
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:03,719
quantum bits hello hi now there are four

51
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,360
possible states of these two electrons

52
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,879
you could think that well it's just like

53
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,060
two bits of a classical computer right

54
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,620
if you have two bits you can write 0 0 0

55
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:18,390
1 1 0

56
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:20,400
one and it's for numbers but these are

57
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,159
still just two bits of information right

58
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,319
all I need to say to determine which one

59
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,810
of the four numbers you have in your

60
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:31,799
computer code is the value of the first

61
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:35,940
bit and the value of the secretary here

62
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:39,540
instead quantum mechanics allows it to

63
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:43,650
make superposition of each one of these

64
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:45,150
four states so I can write a quantum

65
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,459
mechanical state which is perfectly

66
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:50,190
legitimate that is some coefficient

67
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,260
times this plus some coefficient times

68
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,170
that plus some coefficient and that plus

69
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,440
some coefficient so to determine the

70
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:00,709
state of this two spin system I need to

71
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:04,200
give you four numbers four coefficients

72
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:06,150
whereas in the classical example of the

73
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,450
two bits I only need to give you two

74
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:13,319
bits so this is how you understand why

75
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:14,879
two qubits actually contain four bits of

76
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,560
information I need to give you four

77
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,950
numbers to tell you the state of the

78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,739
system whereas here only need two if we

79
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,480
make three spins we would have eight

80
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:27,329
different states I need to give you

81
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,370
eight different numbers to define the

82
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:32,459
state of those three spins whereas

83
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,590
classical is just three bits if you keep

84
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,750
going what you'll find is that the

85
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:41,489
amount of equivalent classical

86
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:46,739
information contained by n qubits is two

87
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:50,609
to the power n classical bits and of

88
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:54,120
course the power of Exponential's tells

89
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:57,510
you that once you have let's say 300 of

90
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,299
those qubits in what we call the fully

91
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:03,269
entangled state so you must be able to

92
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:05,250
create these really crazy states where

93
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:07,139
there is a superposition of all three

94
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,049
others being one way and another way in

95
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:12,480
the other way and so on then you have

96
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:16,139
like two to the three hundred classical

97
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,440
bits which is as many particles as there

98
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,760
are universe but there's a catch

99
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,770
although the qubits can exist in any

100
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,479
combination of states when they are

101
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,219
measured they must fall into one of the

102
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,330
basis states and all the other

103
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:29,669
information about this

104
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:32,669
before the measurement is lost so you

105
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:35,960
don't walk generally to have as the

106
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:38,599
final result of your quantum computation

107
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,560
something that is a very complicated

108
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:42,449
superposition of states because you

109
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,060
cannot measure a superposition you can

110
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:47,060
only measure one of these basis States

111
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:56,699
so what you want is to design the logic

112
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:59,280
operations that you need to get to the

113
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:02,069
final computational result in such a way

114
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,530
that the final result is something

115
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:08,400
you're able to measure it's just a

116
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:11,250
unique state there's no trigger and it's

117
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,069
essentially kind of stretching things

118
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:16,860
there but I guess it's to some degree

119
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:20,849
the reason why quantum computers are not

120
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:23,129
a replacement for classical no no

121
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:26,490
they're not universally faster they're

122
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:30,479
only faster for special types of

123
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:31,979
calculations where you can use the fact

124
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,690
that you have all these quantum

125
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:36,199
superpositions available to you at the

126
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:39,690
same time to do some kind of

127
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:41,839
computational parallelism if you just

128
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:44,099
want to watch a video in height in

129
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:46,979
high-definition or browse the internet

130
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:51,120
or write some document in Word they're

131
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:55,050
not gonna give you any particular rule

132
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,240
if you need to use a classical algorithm

133
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:59,610
to get yourself so you should not think

134
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,699
of a quantum computer as something where

135
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:04,289
every operation is faster in fact every

136
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:06,710
operation is probably gonna be slower

137
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:10,379
then in the computer you have the desk

138
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:12,690
but it's an a computer where the number

139
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:16,650
of operations required to arrive at the

140
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:18,629
result is exponentially small so the

141
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:21,599
improvement is not in the speed of the

142
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:23,490
individual operation is in the total

143
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:25,139
number of operations you need to arrive

144
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:28,139
at the result but that is only the case

145
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:31,540
in particular types of calculations in

146
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:35,110
particular algorithm is not universally

147
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:37,590
which is why it's not a replacement of a

148
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,590
classical
