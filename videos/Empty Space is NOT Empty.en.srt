1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,250
one of the most amazing things about

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,160
atoms is that they are mainly empty

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,469
space if an atom were as wide as your

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,269
arm span then the electrons would all be

5
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:14,849
whizzing about inside the volume

6
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,529
enclosed by your fingertips meanwhile

7
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:19,109
the nucleus would be sitting in the

8
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:23,220
center and its diameter would be smaller

9
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:25,800
than the width of a single human hair so

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,349
all of the atoms that make up you and me

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,740
and all the seemingly solid things in

12
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:34,320
the universe are mostly empty space now

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,620
this is incredible but what is even more

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,070
mind-boggling is that empty space is not

15
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:44,100
truly empty I know because I've seen it

16
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,600
this is a simulation by Professor Derek

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,640
line Webber at the University of

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,950
Adelaide it was made using a

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,590
supercomputer to crunch the calculations

20
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,629
of quantum chromodynamics now that is

21
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,030
the theory of fundamental particles

22
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:59,430
called quarks the building blocks of

23
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,559
protons and neutrons and how they

24
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,629
interact with each other through gluons

25
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,590
what you're looking at here is the

26
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:10,140
energy density of one field fluctuations

27
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,049
where the red spots come out of the

28
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,729
energy density is very high fades down

29
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,159
from the color so in the lowest energy

30
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:19,140
field fluctuations are not rendering

31
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,150
this animation so that we can actually

32
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,220
see into it and what we see is a

33
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,619
bubbling soup of quantum field

34
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,840
fluctuations that come and go incredibly

35
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:31,259
quickly the frame rate of this

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,229
simulation is 1 million billion billion

37
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:36,990
frames per second now that is truly

38
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:40,619
high-speed the dimensions of this box

39
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:43,590
are absolutely tiny they are millionths

40
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:46,320
of a billion of a meter roughly enough

41
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:49,049
space to stick to protons but there are

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,750
no protons here this is a simulation of

43
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,780
the vacuum on its own where we normally

44
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:57,719
think of as empty space empty space is

45
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:01,680
actually full of these cork long field

46
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:05,040
fluctuations and on average it is

47
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,140
possible to annihilate a cork from empty

48
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,790
space because it's not

49
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,800
it just sounds like the most ridiculous

50
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:13,750
idea that you you're meant to have empty

51
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,440
space in it you can go and get rid of

52
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:19,390
stuff from that's right so it is empty

53
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,730
now it seems counterintuitive that the

54
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:24,340
vacuum at its lowest energy state should

55
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:27,250
contain all of this stuff but in fact to

56
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:30,160
clear out the fluctuations and create a

57
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:32,440
truly empty vacuum would require a lot

58
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,180
of energy the empty vacuum actually

59
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,220
costs an enormous amount of energy to

60
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:40,390
create and you were able to create it

61
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:43,240
you discover that it's actually unstable

62
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:46,000
that any sort of perturbation would push

63
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:48,390
that empty vacuum into something where

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,950
the vacuums actually full of

65
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,440
fluctuations well this may not be as

66
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:56,170
strange as it first appears I mean

67
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,900
consider a permanent magnet it has a

68
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:01,270
magnetic field around it at low energy

69
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,160
at room temperature and that's because

70
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:05,650
the individual little magnetic moments

71
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,360
of all the atoms inside are lined up but

72
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,130
if you were to heat it up you would give

73
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,290
thermal energy to all those particles

74
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:13,600
and at a certain point called the Curie

75
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,300
temperature they would be so randomly

76
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,459
aligned that there would no longer be an

77
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,340
overall magnetic field so it actually

78
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:24,160
takes energy to get rid of the permanent

79
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:27,310
magnetic field and this is just like the

80
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,769
quantum vacuum and understanding how the

81
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,140
quantum vacuum fluctuations work gives

82
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:34,269
us a sense of what the fundamental

83
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:37,750
particles do like where are you most

84
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:41,170
likely to find a cork and it turns a or

85
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,120
likes to sit on top of those lumps now

86
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,730
those lumps come into and out of

87
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,380
existence fairly quickly and so we like

88
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,450
to think of the quarks is hopping from

89
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:52,150
one love over to the next lump as it

90
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:55,450
appears and the not another one I like

91
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:58,959
to think of it it's - trying to cross a

92
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:01,480
stream that's running around every now

93
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,400
and then a stone pops up it's the water

94
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,500
swirling rabbits they put your foot

95
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,880
there and you look for the next spot go

96
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,450
quickly enough you might not get your

97
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,700
feet wet so I think quarks are very much

98
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,920
to what we know for server to much doing

99
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,859
the same thing so while it is true that

100
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,720
you and I and all of the other atoms in

101
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:21,700
the universe are mostly empty space

102
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,730
it is also true that

103
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,560
empty space isn't truly empty and in

104
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:30,870
fact it is these vacuum fluctuations

105
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,820
which are essential for our existence

106
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,250
if you're not subscribe to Derek's

107
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,880
channel veritasium I'm not what you're

108
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:41,500
doing with your life it is amazing I got

109
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,420
a pretty fat lip from doing this but

110
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,420
luckily all my teeth were intact
