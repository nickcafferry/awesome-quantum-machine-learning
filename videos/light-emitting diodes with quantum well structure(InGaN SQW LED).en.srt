1
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:08,280
my name is Sonia and I am the second

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,269
presenter October 10th

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,269
I believe you're smart intelligence and

4
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:19,160
listening skills so I believe you

5
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:23,400
understand she explanation about basic

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:25,800
background about our from now I'm going

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:30,449
to show the structure of green single

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,969
continent entities from sapphire zero

9
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:36,809
zero zero one orientation we call that C

10
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:40,739
phase of 2h the other news soft three of

11
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:43,440
these devices and after that I try

12
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:47,700
bomber layer is grown a low temperature

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,980
maybe it's about 550 Celsius as you can

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,030
see this devices there are many layers

15
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,800
each layer has ocean of helping

16
00:00:53,030 --> 00:01:00,600
transportation with carriers and

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:02,940
enhancing quantum efficiencies but the

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,909
most important part in these devices is

19
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,100
this Activision active region forms

20
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:10,170
single quantum structure consisting of

21
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,560
internal nitrile to an off stronger

22
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,500
later

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,600
zebb achieved by and timing tomorrow

24
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,860
night right and we type a reverb and

25
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:23,790
track from each electrode injected

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:27,030
carriers moved into where later and by

27
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,189
electrical cooler horses they create

28
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,000
acetone and we call this phenomenon a

29
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,369
combination

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,549
infantry combination happens light is

31
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:37,920
being emitted from this where there and

32
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:38,670
another thing about this continent right

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,759
over there

34
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:44,620
it has functional reduce the interface

35
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:50,650
trapped between I have not try and

36
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:53,950
I saw straight now you are watching your

37
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:56,460
intensity as a function of wavelength it

38
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:59,590
is divided into three different colors

39
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,900
if it knew more fraction increases the

40
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,700
energy gap is getting smaller it causes

41
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,390
the reduction of wavelengths what does

42
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,270
that mean

43
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:10,470
that means you can change and rediscover

44
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:14,740
through changing into fractions while

45
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:16,540
making devices and here's the second

46
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,480
thing you need in the experimental big

47
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:22,360
wavelengths on green LED is about 525

48
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,760
millimeters but for references other

49
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:29,140
officers condition Nick wavelengths or

50
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:32,170
Breen is about 419 others it's a little

51
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:34,240
bit longer because of this band gap in

52
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:36,760
general we can explain this band gap

53
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,530
narrowing into two different reasons the

54
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,110
first one is different from expansion

55
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:46,270
coefficient second one is large lattice

56
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:49,480
mismatch now you are watching The Fool

57
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:52,180
with with have maximum on PL spectra as

58
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:55,090
a function of big wavelengths even

59
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:58,090
become that wavelength increases the

60
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:00,970
value of a fluid will have maximum also

61
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:03,940
increases here is the mechanism of this

62
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:07,450
if you increase into mole fraction it

63
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:10,000
causes reducing of energy so it

64
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:12,940
increases inferences between where there

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,190
and very earlier so it is caused by the

66
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,530
mismatch of the lattice and the thermal

67
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:22,290
expansion

68
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:24,120
between well and very layers here's the

69
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,329
output power is a function of award

70
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,120
current our team wrote it down each

71
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:35,670
output power and external quantum

72
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:37,200
efficiency here is to two important

73
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:41,639
thing you don't have to remember the

74
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:45,049
first one is saturation above 16 in the

75
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:47,790
out there the output power almost

76
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:50,280
saturated but probably due to the

77
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,439
generation of it the second thing you

78
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,620
have to remember it is comparison

79
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:56,750
between losing quantum LEDs green and

80
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,970
yellow

81
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:02,280
this blue single quantum and LEDs has

82
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:05,939
much higher output power rather than

83
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,519
green and yellow this reason can be

84
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:10,650
explained by this two reasons first one

85
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,079
is differences between the well and the

86
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,760
most thermal expansion coefficient the

87
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:20,729
second one is integrated nitride has

88
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:23,039
large lattice mismatch this is the last

89
00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:25,590
figure of our presentations it's about

90
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:28,590
upper power is a function of a peak

91
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:31,020
wavelength if you increase peak

92
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,780
wavelengths the output power decreases

93
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,910
it's due to the large strain between

94
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:39,260
well and

95
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:41,930
laters now let's compare with newly

96
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:44,360
developed diode engine light rising the

97
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:49,220
quantum enemies and the conventional

98
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:52,130
ones in phosphide and as you can see the

99
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:54,410
output power the engine on my tricycle

100
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:57,590
ultimately it has much higher output

101
00:04:54,410 --> 00:05:01,460
power rather than its to one so you can

102
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:04,070
see more bright color and as you can see

103
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:07,510
the peak wavelength we pointed out five

104
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:13,460
hundred and twenty-five millimeters dead

105
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:17,450
525 represents the brewery color of each

106
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:20,120
wavelength but I'm under the 55 at five

107
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:24,080
hundred and seventy is not purely green

108
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:26,960
it's like yellowish green so in its

109
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,810
final analysis if you want to see more

110
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:36,860
bright and what a green LEDs why don't

111
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:37,910
you use this is the conclusion of our

112
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,710
presentations

113
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,990
the first one is high brightness

114
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:46,150
innovative night rising responsibilities

115
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,150
were brought by the technology culture

116
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:55,000
this we can see quantum well structure

117
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:59,920
and number two and number three is just

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:04,610
experimental data and comparison all

119
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:06,920
this and number four it's about

120
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:09,380
fabrication fabrication of practical

121
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,840
visible LEDs in the range from blue to

122
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:15,290
yellow is possible using three to five I

123
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,080
tried materials that means we could

124
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:21,650
change LEDs color through changing into

125
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:27,860
mole fractions so you can see blue to

126
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:30,290
yellow color this is our references this

127
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,380
is the end of our presentations if you

128
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:36,450
have any questions our team will

129
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,450
answer to you as much as we though
