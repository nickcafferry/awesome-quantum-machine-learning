GOOGLE GROUPS QUANTUM LINKEDLIN QUANTUM MACHINE LEARNING VS DEEP LEARNING QUANTUM MEETUPS RECENT QUANTUM UPDATES FORUM ,PAGES AND NEWSLETTER INTRODUCTION Why Quantum Machine Learning? Machine Learning(ML) is just a term in recent days but the work effort start from 18th century. What is Machine Learning ? , In Simple word the answer is making the computer or application to learn themselves . So its totally related with computing fields like computer science and IT ? ,The answer is not true . ML is a common platform which is mingled in all the aspects of the life from agriculture to mechanics . Computing is a key component to use ML easily and effectively . To be more clear ,Who is the mother of ML ?, As no option Mathematics is the mother of ML . The world tremendous invention complex numbers given birth to this field . Applying mathematics to the real life problem always gives a solution . From Neural Network to the complex DNA is running under some specific mathematical formulas and theorems. As computing technology growing faster and faster mathematics entered into this field and makes the solution via computing to the real world . In the computing technology timeline once a certain achievements reached peoples interested to use advanced mathematical ideas such as complex numbers ,eigen etc and its the kick start for the ML field such as Artificial Neural Network ,DNA Computing etc. Now the main question, why this field is getting boomed now a days ? , From the business perspective , 8-10 Years before during the kick start time for ML ,the big barrier is to merge mathematics into computing field . people knows well in computing has no idea on mathematics and research mathematician has no idea on what is computing . The education as well as the Job Opportunities is like that in that time . Even if a person tried to study both then the business value for making a product be not good. Then the top product companies like Google ,IBM ,Microsoft decided to form a team with mathematician ,a physician and a computer science person to come up with various ideas in this field . Success of this team made some wonderful products and they started by providing cloud services using this product . Now we are in this stage . So what's next ? , As mathematics reached the level of time travel concepts but the computing is still running under classical mechanics . the companies understood, the computing field must have a change from classical to quantum, and they started working on the big Quantum computing field, and the market named this field as Quantum Information Science .The kick start is from Google and IBM with the Quantum Computing processor (D-Wave) for making Quantum Neural Network .The field of Quantum Computer Science and Quantum Information Science will do a big change in AI in the next 10 years.

Soon will be in market QUANTUM HOT TOPICS Deep Quantum Learning why and what is deep learning? In one line , If you know deep learning you can get a good job :) ,Even a different platform undergraduated and graduated person done a master specialization in deep learning can work in this big sector :), Practically speaking machine learning (vector mathematics) , deep learning (vector space(Graphics) mathematics) and big data are the terms created by big companies to make a trend in the market ,but in science and research there is no word such that , Now a days if you ask a junior person working in this big companies ,what is deep learning ,you will get some reply as \"doing linear regression with stochastic gradient for a unsupervised data using Convolutional Neural Network :)\" ,They knows the words clearly and knows how to do programming using that on a bunch of \"relative data\" , If you ask them about the FCM , SVM and HMM etc algorithms ,they will simply say these are olden days algorithms , deep learning replaced all :), But actually they dont know from the birth to the till level and the effectiveness of algorithms and mathematics ,How many mathematical theorems in vector, spaces , tensors etc solved to find this \"hiding the complexity technology\", They did not played with real non relative data like medical images, astro images , geology images etc , finding a relation and features is really complex and looping over n number of images to do pattern matching is a giant work , Now a days the items mentioned as deep learning (= multiple hidden artifical neural network) is not suitable for that why quantum deep learning or deep quantum learning? In the mid of Artificial Neural Network Research people realised at the maximum extreme only certain mathematical operations possible to do with ANN and the aim of this ANN is to achieve parallel execution of many mathematical operations , In artificial Intelligence ,the world intelligence stands for mathematics ,how effective if a probem can be solvable is based on the mathematics logic applying on the problem , more the logic will give more performance(more intelligent), This goal open the gate for quantum artificial neural network, On applying the ideas behind the deep learning to quantum mechanics environment, its possible to apply complex mathematical equations to n number of non relational data to find more features and can improve the performance Quantum Machine Learning vs Deep Learning Its fun to discuss about this , In recent days most of the employees from Product Based Companies Like google,microsoft etc using the word deep learning ,What actually Deep Learning ? and is it a new inventions ? how to learn this ? Is it replacing machine learning ? these question come to the mind of junior research scholars and mid level employees The one answer to all questions is deep learning = parallel \"for\" loops ,No more than that ,Its an effective way of executing multiple tasks repeatly and to reduce the computation cost, But it introduce a big cap between mathematics and computerscience , How ? All classical algorithms based on serial processing ,Its depends on the feedback of the first loop ,On applying a serial classical algorithm in multiple clusters wont give a good result ,but some light weight parallel classical algorithms(Deep learning) doing the job in multiple clusters and its not suitable for complex problems, What is the solution for then? As in the title Quantum Machine Learning ,The advantage behind is deep learning is doing the batch processing simply on the data ,but quantum machine learning designed to do batch processing as per the algorithm The product companies realised this one and they started migrating to quantum machine learning and executing the classical algorithms on quantum concept gives better result than deep learning algorithms on classical computer and the target to merge both to give very wonderful result References Google - Google Research Discussion IBM Project - IBM Project idea IBM - IBM plan to merge both Microsoft - Microsoft plan to merge both MIT and Google - Solutions for all questions Pdf - Nice Discussion Quora - Good Discussion Quora - The Bridge Discussion QUANTUM MEETUPS Meetup 10 - Quantum Physics Sydney Australia Meetup 11 - Quantum Physics Berkeley CA Meetup 12 - Quantum Computing London UK Meetup 13 - Quantum Mechanics Carmichael CA Meetup 14 - Maths and Science Group Portland Meetup 15 - Quantum Physics Santa Monica, CA Meetup 16 - Quantum Mechanics London Meetup 17 - Quantum Computing London Meetup 18 - Quantum Meta Physics ,Kansas City , Missouri ,US Meetup 19 - Quantum Mechanics and Physics ,Boston ,Massachusetts ,US Meetup 1 - Quantum Physics Meetup 20 - Quantum Physics and Mechanics ,San Francisco ,California Meetup 21 - Quantum Mechanics ,Langhorne, Pennsylvania Meetup 22 - Quantum Mechanics ,Portland Meetup 2 - Quantum Computing London Meetup 3 - Quantum Computing New York Meetup 4 - Quantum Computing Canada Meetup 5 - Quantum Artificial Intelligence Texas Meetup 6 - Genarl Quantum Mechanics , Mathematics New York Meetup 7 - Quantum Computing Mountain View California Meetup 8 - Statistical Analysis New York Meetup 9 - Quantum Mechanics London UK QUANTUM BASED DEGREES Plenty of courses around the world and many Universities Launching it day by day ,Instead of covering only Quantum ML , Covering all Quantum Related topics gives more idea in the order below Available Courses Quantum Mechanics for Science and Engineers Online edx - Quantum Mechanics for Everyone Standford university - Nice Preparatory Course NPTEL 5 NPTEL 1 - Nice Series of Courses to understand basics and backbone of quantum mechanics NPTEL 2 NPTEL 3 NPTEL 4 Class Based Course UK Bristol Australia Australian National University Europe Maxs Planks University Quantum Physics Online MIT - Super Explanation and well basics NPTEL - Nice Series of Courses to understand basics and backbone of quantum Physics Class Based Course Europe University of Copenhagen Quantum Chemistry Online NPTEL 1 - Nice Series of Courses to understand basics and backbone of quantum Chemistry NPTEL 2 - Class Based Course Europe UGent Belgium Quantum Computing Online edx - Nice Explanation MIT - Super Explanation and well basics NPTEL - Nice Series of Courses to understand basics and backbone of quantum Computing Class Based Course Canada uwaterloo Singapore National University Singapore USA Berkley China Baidu Quantum Technology Class Based Course Canada uwaterloo Singapore National University Singapore Europe Munich Russia Skoltech Quantum Information Science External Links quantwiki Online edx - Nice Explanation MIT - Super Explanation and well basics NPTEL - Nice Series of Courses to understand basics and backbone of quantum information and computing Class Based Course USA MIT Standford University Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science - University of Maryland Canada Perimeter Institute Singapore National University Singapore Europe ULB Belgium IQOQI Quantum Electronics Online MIT - Wonderful Course NPTEL - Nice Series of Courses to understand basics and backbone of quantum Electronics Class Based Course USA Texas Europe Zurich ICFO Asia Tata Institute Quantum Field Theory Online Standford university - Nice Preparatory Course edx - Some QFT Concepts available Class Based Course UK Imperial Europe Vrije Quantum Computer Science Class Based Course USA Oxford Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science - University of Maryland Quantum Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning External Links Quora 1 Artificial Agents Research for Quantum Designs Quora 1 Quantum Mathematics Class Based Course USA University of Notre *** CONSOLIDATED Quantum Research Papers [Murphy Yuezhen Niu] (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0wJPxfkAAAAJ&hl=en) - A good researcher published some nice articles Peter Wittek - Famous Researcher for the Quantum Machine Leanrning , Published a book in this topic scirate - Plenty of Quantum Research Papers Available Recent Quantum Updates forum ,pages and newsletter facebook Quantum Machine Learning - Running By me .
